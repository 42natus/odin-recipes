        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple but delicious crêpe recipe can be made in minutes from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li><small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></small> cup milk</li>
            <li><small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></small> water</li>
            <li><small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> </small>teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; 
                add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup 
                for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter 
                coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has 
                turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of 
                the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side 
                has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
